# Trophies
PicksLeague features the awarding of trophies at the end of each week that are for a user meeting specific criteria with their slate of picks for the week and season. Examples of criteria that would garner a trophy award can be as simple as most wins in a given week but can also grow in complexity, like correctly picking all winning road underdogs in a week. The trophies carry a phrase or name of a sports icon associated with the given achievement. For instance, the trophy for correctly picking all winning road underdogs in a week could be called the Joey B (named for Joe Burrow who won notable playoff games on the road as an underdog in the 2021 playoffs).
